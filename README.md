# diffinplaylist

my first solo project i made to store links of songs i listened to, got tired of all different apps and playlists just wanted one central

plans i got on the future for this is to learn nextjs and add a menu button where u can add multiple playlists 

ignore the cloud and lightning button lmao i made that to farm A's in my literature class irl
